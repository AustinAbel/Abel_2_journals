At Rackspace, the most important skills noted for achieving employment were problem-solving and active code development.
For example, presenters noted that they would be most likely to hire someone who goes home and spends hours working with Linux and networking.

Does that describe you? Why or why not?
Not a the present. If a have free time, though, I do work on Linux.

Similarly, presenters noted a demand for employees who were good at independent problem solving. Does that describe you? Why or why not?
Yes, I tend to think computationally.

Have you finished your disk image? Why or why not? 
Yes.
